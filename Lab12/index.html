            <p>Cleveland, Ohio, nicknamed "The Forest City" is the seat of Cuyahoga County and is ranked as the 32nd Largest Metropolitan Area in the US.</p>
            <p>Cleveland has a rich history and many great things to offer, including a bustling food scene, numerous venues in which to appreciate the arts, and many sports to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Cleveland has a population of approximately 380,000 residents, while the Greater Clevelad Area consists of just over 2,000,000 people.</p>
            <p>Cleveland was founded in 1796 by European settlers near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. Because of its proximity to the river, Cleveland naturally became a manufacturing hub. The Cuyahoga River famously caught on fire more than a dozen times between the late nineteenth century and 1969. The last fire, in June of 1969, spurred a national environmental movement, culminating in the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972.</p>
            <p>Cleveland was named after Moses Cleaveland and was incorporated as a city in 1836.</p>
            <p>According to the 2010 Census, Cleveland is comprised of approximately 53% African American residents, 37% White, 0.3% Native American, 1.8% Asian, 10% Latino, and the remainder being other races or individuals of more than one race.</p>
            <p>Some famous people from Cleveland include Steve Harvey, Bob Hope, Dr. Oz, Arsenio Hall, Drew Carey, Halle Berry, and Terrence Howard.</p>
